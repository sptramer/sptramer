### Hello humans

I'm Steve. I used to be an engineer, primarily working in C and C++, but I can overflow any buffer on any letter of the alphabet. According to LinkedIn, I am the foremost expert on Final Fantasy V in the world. Apparently I'm also an expert on the roguelike genre, as I have now explained it at least on five different podcasts. I believe this makes me an expert in what they call "Game Studies".

As an engineer, I did everything from write job-management queue software for the Large Hadron Collider (hopefully no longer used in production) to an iPhone app that scans a barcode on a tractor. I was fortunate enough to ship _four whole products_ during my career as an engineer, out of a total of 10 or 12 or so. My background there is in high-performance networking and failover persistence, foreign function interfaces, language runtimes, mobile platforms, and software architecture and design. I'm mostly described as a "talented generalist."

These days I describe my professional interests as "making computers less bad." Almost all users of computers agree: They're worse than they should be. So I've become a technical writer with an emphasis on understanding devops infrastructure for docs, API and core code concepts documentation, and other engineer-to-English translations that help users (whether they're also developers or not.)

Currently, I work on [Open 3D Engine](https://www.o3de.org/). Would you like to help game developers build a better world based on open source software, where production pipelines can be better controled and separated, and technical stacks can be shared? I encourage you to contribute to [code](https://github.com/o3de/o3de) or [docs](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org).
