### Hello humans

I'm Steve. I used to be an engineer, primarily working in C and C++, but I can overflow any buffer on any letter of the alphabet. I've been a technical writer with a brief mangement detour for the last 5 years, and before that I was a software developer and engineer for something like 15 in total. I've also paid rent by editing textbooks, teaching, and being a "professional comedy writer" for material so embarrassing I used a pen name.

As an engineer, I did everything from write job queue management software for the Large Hadron Collider to an iPhone app that scans a barcode on a tractor. I guess that what I have the best knowledge of, and tend to be the most interested in, is high-performance networking and failover persistence, foreign function interfaces, language runtimes, developing on restrictive platforms, and software architecture and design. I'm mostly described as a "talented generalist."

These days I describe my professional interests as "making computers less bad." Almost all users of computers agree: They're worse than they should be. So I've become a technical writer with an emphasis on understanding devops infrastructure for docs, API and core code concepts documentation, and other engineer-to-English translations that help users (whether they're also developers or not.)
