### Hello humans

I'm Steve. I used to be an engineer, primarily working in C and C++, but I can overflow any buffer on any letter of the alphabet. I've been a technical writer with a brief mangement detour since, and before that I was a software developer and engineer for something like 15 in total. I've also paid rent by editing textbooks, teaching, and being a "professional comedy writer" for material so embarrassing I used a pen name.

These days I describe my professional interests as "making computers less bad and more human." Almost all users of computers agree: They're worse than they should be. So I've become a technical writer with an emphasis on understanding devops infrastructure for docs, API and core code concepts documentation, and other engineer-to-English translations that help people (whether they're developers or not.)
