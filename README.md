### Hello humans

I'm Steve. I used to be an engineer, primarily working in C and C++, but I can overflow any buffer on any language. I have written both software that runs the Large Hadron Collider (though I hope my code is no longer used in production) and an iPhone app that scans a barcode on a tractor.

These days I only do engineering for fun and mostly in Rust and ancient assembly on simple architectures, because doing these things are impractical and therefore only interesting (to me) and not especially useful (to others). I make an effort to release all software I develop in my off-time under the anarchist licensing principle that no code may be used for any legal reason, because it absolutely should not be.

Professionally, I'm a technical writer with an emphasis on understanding devops infrastructure for docs, API and core code concepts documentation, and other engineer-to-English translations that help users (whether they're also developers or not.)

Currently, I work on [Open 3D Engine](https://www.o3de.org/) and am the chair of the [Documentation and Community Special Interest Group](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community). Would you like to help game developers build a better world based on open source software, where production pipelines can be better controled and separated, and technical stacks can be shared? I encourage you to contribute to [code](https://github.com/o3de/o3de) or [docs](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org).
